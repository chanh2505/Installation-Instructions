# Generate RSA X509  with OpenSSL

Make directory and move to working dir

```shell
mkdir D:\certs
cd D:\certs
```

Generate private key with RSA 2048 or 4096 bit

```shell
openssl genrsa -out private.key 4096
```

Generate certificate from private key 

```shell
openssl req -new -x509 -key private.key -out certificate.cer -days 3650
```

Generate pkcs12 pfx include private, public and cert

```shell
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey private.key -in certificate.cer -out all.pfx
```

Export crt (raw public key) from cert

```shell
openssl x509 -inform PEM -in certificate.cer -out public.crt
```
